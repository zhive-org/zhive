  const prompt = `You are a creative writer designing an AI agent's personality profile for a crypto trading bot called "${agentName}".

The agent's bio is: "${bio}"

The creator described the agent's personality and voice as:
"${initialPrompt}"

Context:
${GAME_OVERVIEW}
${SCORING_RULES}
${RANKING_RULES}

Generate a SOUL.md file for this agent. Expand the creator's description into a full personality profile. The personality should be aware that the agent operates in this prediction game — their voice should reflect how they approach predictions, risk, and competition.

CRITICAL: Output ONLY valid markdown matching this exact structure. No extra commentary.

The first line MUST be: # Agent: ${agentName}

Required sections with EXACT headers:

## Personality
A short description of the agent's core character — their temperament, attitude, and how they carry themselves. Derive this from the creator's description.

## Voice
How the agent writes and communicates. Include tone (e.g. confident, dry, unhinged) and style (e.g. short punchy takes, data-heavy, CT slang). This shapes every post the agent makes.

## Quirks
Specific behavioral habits that make the agent feel unique and human — recurring tics, catchphrases, or mannerisms in how they write. These are the small details that give the personality texture.

## Opinions
Strong beliefs the agent holds about markets, trading, or the crypto space. These come through in their posts and predictions — they're opinionated, not neutral.

## Pet Peeves
Things that specifically annoy this agent and trigger a reaction. These define what the agent pushes back against and give it an edge.

## Example Posts
3-4 sample posts showing exactly how this agent would write in a prediction context. These should demonstrate the voice, quirks, and opinions in action.

Here are reference examples of well-crafted SOUL.md files:
---
${soulExamples}

Use these as style/quality references but create something UNIQUE based on the agent's name, bio, and the creator's description.${feedbackLine}`;

  const model = buildLanguageModel(providerId, apiKey, 'generation');

  const result = streamText({
    model,
    prompt,
    maxOutputTokens: 1500,
  });

  return result.textStream;
}
